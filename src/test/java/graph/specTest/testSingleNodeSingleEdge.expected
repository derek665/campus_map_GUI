# test when a single node has a circular edge (same node for parent and child)

# Create a graph
Created graph circular

# Add single node
added node n1 to circular

# Add an edge to n1
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in circular

# Print the nodes in graph
circular contains: n1

# Print the children in graph
the children of n1 in circular are: n1(e1)
