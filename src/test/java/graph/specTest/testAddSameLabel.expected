# test when an edge with same label, parent, child is added

# Create graph
created graph dupl2

# Add 2 nodes
added node n1 to dupl2
added node n2 to dupl2

# Add 1 edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in dupl2

# Add the same edge again
# no change since e1 already exists

# Print children of n1
the children of n1 in dupl2 are: n2(e1)
