# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# an edge between them can be added, and a pair of nodes
# and edges can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph g4

# Add pair of nodes
added node n1 to g4
added node n2 to g4

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g4
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in g4

# Print nodes of graph
g4 contains: n1 n2

# Print children of each node
the children of n1 in g4 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in g4 are: n1(e2)
