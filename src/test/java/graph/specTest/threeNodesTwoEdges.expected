# Tests that a graph can be created, three nodes and
# two edges from the same node, and the three nodes
# and the two edges can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph g3

# Add 3 nodes to graph
added node n1 to g3
added node n2 to g3
added node n3 to g3

# Add 2 edges from n1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g3
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in g3

# Print nodes in graph and edges from n1
g3 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in g3 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
