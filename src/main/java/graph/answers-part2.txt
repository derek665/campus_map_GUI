Problem 1

(a) Collection of edges: The advantage of this implementation is that it is much easier to find edges between nodes,
                         calling get on the collection, and to modify note just simply add it to the collection or remove it
                         The disadvantage of this can be the complexity to gather up
                         the nodes of the graph, we have to analyze all the edge to find the nodes of the class

    Adjacency list: The advantages are it is easier to add new note because it is simple to add a new key to a map,
                    getting nodes are also less complex as we can just return all the key
                    The disadvantages are it is more complex to remove nodes, because it needs to go in depth to
                    find which nodes are adjacent to another, when removing a node we also need to dive into other nodes' neighbors
                    to see if the node we are removing is one of the child. Which can be really long in terms of run time

    Adjacency matrix: Advantage of adjaency matrix is that it is has the less run time when modifying the edges between nodes
                      Disadvantage is that it is significant longer in run time when modifying nodes in the graph
                      because the size also needs to be modify, but size stays the same when modifying edges

(b) I chose the adjacency list because I feel like this specific implementation is the most intuitive to my when it comes to
    designing the class, and all the methods have pretty similar run time.

Problem 4

I changed one line of Javadoc in addChild @spec.effects because I think the old one has exposure to private field

I believed my test unit is sufficient enough so I didn't add tests to the test suit
because it has tests for many different cases of the graph, it covers pretty much all operations of the graph.
