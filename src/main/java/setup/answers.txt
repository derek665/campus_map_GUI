Problem 6.

(a) The original code had (n <= 0) for the test case,
    so each time a 0 is passed, it causes an exception.
    I fixed it by changing to (n < 0) since 0 is a legal argument for n

(b) The original code had (n <= 2) to return 1 for a base case.
    But for n == 2, the answer should be 1 + 1 instead of 1.
    So I fixed it by changing the test to (n < 2)

(c) The original code had getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2),
    which made the final result wrong. I changed the line to
    getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2) and the final result is correct


Problem 7. 

I changed the constructor to this.volume = volume,
so the parameter is stored to the field of the class.
I also changed the getVolume() method to return the volume field instead of 0
