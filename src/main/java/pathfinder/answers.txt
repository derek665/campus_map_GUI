CSE 331 Homework.  Answers to written questions.

I added 3 public methods to Graph
	1. hasEdge(String, Edge), this is to test if specific edge exists and has the parent node. It is pretty much same as hasLabel,
   	   but since Edge class is now public, and being returned in some other methods. I think it is more convenient to have Edge parameter as well as Strings
   	2. addChild(String, Edge), alternative to addChild(String, String, String), same reasons as above
   	3. removeEdgeFrom(String, Edge), alternative to removeEdgeFrom(String, String, String), same reasons as #1
