CSE 331 Homework.  Answers to written questions.

I added 3 public methods to Graph
	1. hasEdge(String, Edge), this is to test if specific edge exists and has the parent node. It is pretty much same as hasLabel,
   	   but since Edge class is now public, and being returned in some other methods. I think it is more convenient to have Edge parameter as well as Strings
   	2. addChild(String, Edge), alternative to addChild(String, String, String), same reasons as above
   	3. removeEdgeFrom(String, Edge), alternative to removeEdgeFrom(String, String, String), same reasons as #1

I took out "implements Comparable" in both the Graph and Edge since we can't compare generics,
I added a private Comparator class to MarvelPaths, and the implTest for Graph and MarvelPaths in order for me to get my edges in a sorted order
