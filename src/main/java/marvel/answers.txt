Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW 3-4 and why
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

I added a public method hasLabel to Graph that checks if specific label exists between parent node and child node

I changed Edge class from private inner class to a public class, so it is easier when I am making the path to have
an Edge class rather than a Map<child, Set<label>> which can get really messy, and it is easier to distinguish alphabetically.
From changing it to public class, I also made another test file for Edge, changed all the methods in Graph with appropriate return type
, and changed the GraphTest to make sure it has the right type for the method and assert.
